# Shell-factory-cocos
Shell-factory-cocos (shell-factory common commands) extends the functionality of [shell-factory](https://github.com/monstermichl/shell-factory) by a set of commands generally used in shell scripts. This collection is by no means complete and should be extended by anyone who thinks something is missing :)

## Usage
All commands build upon the Command class which is a subclass of [Statement](https://github.com/monstermichl/shell-factory#statement). This way each command can simply be added to a block as usual.

At the moment the following commands are supported.
- echo
- ls
- touch
- mkdir
- grep
- man
- pwd
- mv
- cp
